# The Morning Post

It's nice to have something interesting to read with your morning coffee. My task with this project is to write a Go program that will curate a little “morning newspaper” for you.

It's a full stack program including GUI.

## Getting started

Run program and open your browser at http://localhost:33000

```bash
$ run cmd/morningpost/main.go
2023/04/03 10:22:11 Listening at http://0.0.0.0:33000
```
